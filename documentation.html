                <p>
                    AuCo is a useful tool for amateur autograph collectors, that allows users to organize their acquired autographs and store their
                    unique specifications and descriptions. This website helps collectors access their own autograph database easily and gain
                    insight on some global statistics. AuCo uses a personal system of estimating values within the app, and every autograph
                    has a value expressed in auco points. Also, users can access their own statistics in order to see information like their total
                    value acquired in points.

                    This product has two dependencies. The main one is represented by the chosen hosting server and the
                    other one consists of the database used for storing all the user data. Any problem that occurs regarding
                    the database or the host provider that threatens this product can be solved by switching to another
                    third party provider. In addition, any memory issues that may occur will determine AuCo to expand
                    the available storage with the help of future investments.

                            This feature is triggered by the user after clicking the "New Autograph"
                            button, which triggers the interfaces' response. Next, the user has to
                            provide the required specifications and upload a photo, which are added
                            to the database.

                            searchbar. The website provides the matching elements after searching

                            button within an autograph element. The website will ask for
                            confirmation and by accepting, the database will be updated, and feedback

                <p>
                    This feature lets the user see his own statistics and the global ones
                    displayed. This is not a very high priority feature because the main scope
                    of the website is achievable without it, but it can get the users to be
                    more involved.
